    const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

    const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?

    // In this code, birthday is exactly like that. So we could use the upper case for it.

    // In contrast, age is evaluated in run-time. 
    // Today we have one age, a year after we’ll have another one. 
    // It is constant in a sense that it does not change through the code execution. 
    // But it is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday: it is calculated, so we should keep the lower case for it.
