    // Internal algorithms
    // Generational collection – objects are split into two sets: “new ones” and “old ones”. 
    // In typical code, many objects have a short life span: they appear, do their job and die fast, 
    // so it makes sense to track new objects and clear the memory from them if that’s the case. 
    // Those that survive for long enough, become “old” and are examined less often.
    
    // Incremental collection – if there are many objects, and we try to walk and mark the whole object set at once, 
    // it may take some time and introduce visible delays in the execution. 
    // So the engine splits the whole set of existing objects into multiple parts. 
    // And then clear these parts one after another. There are many small garbage collections instead of a total one. 
    // That requires some extra bookkeeping between them to track changes, but we get many tiny delays instead of a big one.
    
    // Idle-time collection – the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, 
    // to reduce the possible effect on the execution.
